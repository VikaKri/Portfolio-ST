              Hi, I am Syune Tatevosyan. I've been studying music for more than
              10 years(piano, music theory) as well as performing on stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always tried to be connected with music at all stages of my
              life. I have organized many concerts and formed a music band in
              the early years of my studies, which developed my organizational
              skills. Since starting BIMM university I have been a part of
              several bands as a keyboard player and performed on thestagesasO2
              Islington, O2 Shepherd's Bush and The Water Rats. Moreover,during
              my final year I was working on a musical bum which was related to
              the impact of social media and technologies to our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Above all, my biggest passion is composing and arranging
              music.I've been composing music on the piano since I was9. I have
              a basic knowledge of sound engineering,but I'm keen to learn it at
              a more advanced level.
            </p>
